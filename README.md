## What is aerospace engineering?
<p>Aerospace engineering is the field of study of the design and development of aircraft and spacecraft. Jobs for this field can range from mechanical engineers to quality inspectors and even managers. Many companies that specialize in aerospace engineering such as Boeing will make billions of dollars every year from contracting to commercial airline companies and even the U.S. military. As of 2018 according to CNBC, Boeing has made a total revenue of $101 billion, which was a record high for Boeing.</p>
## Why is aerospace engineering so important?
<p>As engineers create newer and more expesive aircraft with new technologies, there will be more problems regarding the aircraft. This can cause safety issues with the aircraft and can put lives at stake. It is the job of the engineers to work together to solve these problems to ensure the safety of others aboard the aircraft. Also, we rely on aerospace engineering to create satellites to help us collect data on the Earth's surface and beyond. For example, weather satellites are able to use sensors to track cloud patterns to find hurricanes and infared sensors are used to see the temperature of these clouds. Other satellies such as the Voyager 1 which was deployed by NASA had missions objectives to discover planets in the solar system close up.</p>
## Why is aerospace engineering important to the U.S. military?
Every year the U.S. military spends billions in order to keep the country safe. As of 2018, the U.S. military spent close to $700 billion on the military alone.
