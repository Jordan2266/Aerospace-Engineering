## What is aerospace engineering?
<p>Aerospace engineering is the field of study of the design and development of aircraft and spacecraft. Jobs for this field can range from mechanical engineers to quality inspectors and even managers. Many companies that specialize in aerospace engineering such as Boeing will make billions of dollars every year from contracting to commercial airline companies and even the U.S. military. As of 2018 according to CNBC, Boeing has made a total revenue of $101 billion, which was a record high for Boeing.</p>

## Why is aerospace engineering so important?
<p>As engineers create newer and more expesive aircraft with new technologies, there will be more problems regarding the aircraft. This can cause safety issues with the aircraft and can put lives at stake. It is the job of the engineers to work together to solve these problems to ensure the safety of others aboard the aircraft. Also, we rely on aerospace engineering to create satellites to help us collect data on the Earth's surface and beyond. For example, weather satellites are able to use sensors to track cloud patterns to find hurricanes and infared sensors are used to see the temperature of these clouds. Other satellies such as the Voyager 1 which was deployed by NASA had missions objectives to discover planets in the solar system close up.</p>

## Misconceptions about flight today
<p>Based on events within the past few years, many commercial airline companies have faced criticism and backlash for aircraft crashing or disappearing. This has caused many people today to have a phobia of flying on an airplane or getting even near one. But there in reality there is no reason to fear dieing in an airplane crash. According to the Economist, the odds of dieing in a plane crash is about one in 5.4 million and other sources claim the odds to be one in 11 million! Based on these odds, you are more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident and the odds of this happening are 1 in 103 according to the website Injuryfacts.</p>

## Why is aerospace engineering important to the U.S. military?
<p>Every year the U.S. military spends billions in order to keep the country safe. As of 2018, the U.S. military spent close to $700 billion on the military alone for weapon manufactering companies to create equipment for the military. These can range from large C-130 military transport aircraft to small drones that can fit inside your pocket. Aircraft in the U.S. military have proven time and time again to be extremely important in dangerous combat environments and even far outside of a warzone. For example, during World War 2, the U.S. Navy relied heavily on aircraft in the Pacific theatre to establish aerial dominance and as they were within range of Japan, the Navy used it's B-17 bombers to attack.</p>
<p>Apart from combat purposes, the U.S. military will also use aircraft for non-combat roles within the military. For example, the KC-10 runs aerial refueling missions for fighter jets that are on missions. The KC-10 uses an extension nozzle on the rear of the aircraft to transfer fuel from the KC-10 to the aircraft it's being connected to which allows combat aircraft to fly longer and run missions longer.</p>
